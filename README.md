# Open Checker
![Screenshot of Open Checker](showcase/Screenshot_1.png)

Open Checker is an all-in-one solution for managing League of Legends accounts.

My biggest project that took me 6 months of constant coding to finish. I started this with no prior experience in LCU or RC API's for League.

If importing accounts does not work for you, run PowerShell as administrator and type `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`.

Please add my Discord if you need help/support or have a question regarding my GitHub projects. Don't add me if you want me to code/add something for you.

NOTE: I have used OC on my main machine before and after Vanguard without any punishment, but I can not tell if it is gonna be bannable in the future. Use at your own risk!

NOTE 2: While importing, it will ask you for account password to find the creation date, last password change date and other info. This was unfortunately recently patched by Riot.

# üõ†Ô∏è Running and troubleshooting

### How to run?

#### First run
1. Download all the files from this repository in .ZIP
2. Extract the full .ZIP in a folder (the files must be in same folder together, otherwise it won't launch)
3. Open PowerShell as Administrator, type in `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` (this is necessary for importing, read more at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.4)
4. Open `start.bat` and confirm the smartscreen warning
5. Scroll down using controls to `Update/repair...` and press X to update to all cosmetics the newest patch
   
#### After first run
1. Open `start.bat`

### How to create first list?
1. Open your explorer, desktop, wherever you want
2. Create a text file, name it for example `test.txt`
3. Rename the file extension from `.txt` to `.ockr`
4. Now you have your first list! Lists serve as holders of all the account data.

### üìë How to open a list?

#### - Associating file extension (best way)
1. Open `start.bat` as administrator (yes, has to be as administrator)
2. Select `Associate .OCKR files with start.bat` and press X
3. Now you should be able to just double-click any `.OCKR` list and it will launch it.

#### - If associating does not work for you
1. Drag `.OCKR` on `start.bat` and it will launch the list

#### - In explorer
1. Open `start.bat`
2. Select `Select list in explorer window`
3. In the explorer window find the desired `.OCKR` file and select it

#### - Dragging in the window
1. Open `start.bat`
2. Select `Drag into this window to import a list`
3. Drag your `.OCKR` file in the window, it will copy the filepath and press enter.

### Importing my first account
1. Open a created `.OCKR` list
2. Using Q-E controls, select above `Import` and press X
3. Log in your League of Legends account and launch League
4. Select variant `Import from account you are logged to currently`
5. Type in `no` if it asks you for password
6. Your account should be imported in the list you select prior to importing.

### Troubleshooting FAQ
- Importing works currently only for `Import from account you are logged to currently`, not for combolists/credentials because of Riot API changes
- Does importing not work at all, or it leaves a bunch of weird words in the list file? Open PowerShell as administrator and type in `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`, restart the app.
- If something else does not work, contact me on Discord or open an issue.
- Why is this so hard to use? Because I never expected I would release it. I made it just perfect for me to work fast with it. I do not use this program anymore, so I will not keep it up-to date. If you don't like the controls, feel free to go purchase a 1) different checker 2) residential proxies with sticky sessions 3) working captcha solver. This program is a perfect solution for "home" users that would like to export few of their smurfs, not for mass importing.

# Account Saving System

## Overview
OC saves account data in plain text. No passwords or other private info are encrypted.

---

## Structure
- **Account Start/End Tags:**  
  Each accounts data is encapsulated with `account-<number>-start` and `account-<number>-end` tags to separate individual accounts.

- **Indexing:**  
  Each field is indexed by account ID:
  - `login[1]`: Login information for the first account.
  - `login[2]`: Login information for the second account.

---

## Format
  - All account data are in file `listname.ockr` (.ockr is the extension for Open Checker data files)
  - Files with other extensions can not be used as Open Checker data files.

---

## Example
```plaintext
account-1-start
login[1]=exampleLogin
region[1]=NA
email[1]=example@email.com
skinsamount[1]=5
skin_name[1][1]=PAX Jax
skin_name[1][2]=Neo PAX Jax
account-1-end
```
