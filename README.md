# Open Checker
![Screenshot of Open Checker](showcase/Screenshot_1.png)

Open Checker is an all-in-one solution for managing League of Legends accounts.

My biggest project that took me 6 months of constant coding to finish. I started this with no prior experience in LCU or RC API's for League.

If importing accounts does not work for you, run PowerShell as administrator and type `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`.

NOTE: I have used OC on my main machine before and after Vanguard without any punishment, but I can not tell if it is gonna be bannable in the future. Use at your own risk!

NOTE 2: While importing, it will ask you for account password to find the creation date, last password change date and other info. This was unfortunately recently patched by Riot.


## üåü Overview

### Main Tab Information:
- **Account Details:**
  - Region, Username, Summoner Name, Email, Level
  - RP, BE, Champion Count, Skin Count, Rare Skin Count
  - Solo/Duo Rank, Flex Queue Rank

# Account Saving System

## Overview
OC saves account data in plain text. No passwords or other private info are encrypted.

---

## Structure
- **Account Start/End Tags:**  
  Each accounts data is encapsulated with `account-<number>-start` and `account-<number>-end` tags to separate individual accounts.

- **Indexing:**  
  Each field is indexed by account ID:
  - `login[1]`: Login information for the first account.
  - `login[2]`: Login information for the second account.

---

## Format
  - All account data are in file `listname.ockr` (.ockr is the extension for Open Checker data files)
  - Files with other extensions can not be used as Open Checker data files.

---

## Example
```plaintext
account-1-start
login[1]=exampleLogin
region[1]=NA
email[1]=example@email.com
skinsamount[1]=5
skin_name[1][1]=PAX Jax
skin_name[1][2]=Neo PAX Jax
account-1-end
```
